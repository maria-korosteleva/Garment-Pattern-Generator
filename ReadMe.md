# Generating Datasets of 3D Garments with Sewing Patterns

![Examples of Garments generated with our pipeline](img/data_samples.png)

Official implementation of [Generating Datasets of 3D Garments with Sewing Patterns](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.05633) (accepted to NeurIPS 2021 Dataset and Benchmarks Track).

## News!

* Nov. 21, 2022: switched to using Maya 2022+. NOTE: Support for earlier versions is removed. Use the state before the last merge to use the generator with Maya below 2022

## Dataset

Using this data generator, we created a [Dataset of 3D Garments with Sewing patterns](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5267549) consisting of 19 garment types and more then 20 000 garment samples. 

> The dataset is available on Zenodo: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5267549.

If you have problems, questions, or suggestions regarding the dataset, please [open an issue](https://github.com/maria-korosteleva/Garment-Pattern-Generator/issues) with `dataset` label.

### ToDo (future work)
* Reformat template spec description for easy reading
* Allow to turn off or chose simpler renderer for getting the datasets faster
* Adding support for other curve types
* Body Pose variations
* Body Shape variations
* Fabric properties sampling
* Swithcing to Open Source cloth simulator
